This repo is for assignments/projects I will be creating for my Software Practicum (capstone requirement for my C.S. Master's).

It will contain a mix of languages (so far Java, C++, C#).

Assignments so far:
InsertionSort (implement in Java and C++)
Quadtree drawing (C# with Visual Studio)

PLEASE NOTE:
My professor takes a rather extreme approach to eXtreme Programming and wants us to prioritize frequent releases and story completion over coding best practices. 
I hope to get some time soon to refactor and reorganize the Quadtree code.
